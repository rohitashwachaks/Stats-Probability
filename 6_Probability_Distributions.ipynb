        "So far we have covered probability distributions as functions that map probabilities to each of the possible outcomes of a random variable. The sum of all the probabilities of a probability distribution must equal 1 (as they include 100% of the possible outcomes). However, depending on the properties of the random variable we are looking at, the mathematical tools that we looked at before cannot directly be applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the example we covered in the __\"Probability\"__ notebook with the dart throw where the random variable was the area where the dart landed. There were four distinct, countable possible outcomes for the random variable. This is known as a __discrete random variable__, and follows a __discrete probability distribution__, where there is a __finite, countable number of possible outcomes__. This means that we can assign probabilities to each of the outcomes. Since for the dart throw example, we had a discrete probability distribution, we were able to assign individual probabilities to each individual outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, not all all random variables follow a _discrete_ distribution. What if I chose to investigate a random variable $X$, representing the height of a randomly selected student in a classroom. If I have a perfect ruler that measures with perfect accuracy, how many possible heights are there that can be observed? While perhaps not intuitive at first, the answer is that there are __infinitely many options__. \n",
        "\n",
        "This is not necessarily to do with treating a height of 0cm or a height of $\\infty$cm as possibilities. One way to look at this is that if I pick any two possible heights, there is always a possible height in between:\n",
        "- If I pick the heights 169cm and 170cm, someone can still be 169.5cm\n",
        "- If I pick the heights 169cm and 169.5cm, someone can still be 169.25cm\n",

        "And we can carry out this process indefinitely. This means that even within a small range, we have infinitely many possible values our random variable can take. This is known as a __continuous random variable__, and follows a __continuous probability distribution__, where there is an __infinite, uncountable number of possible outcomes__. One more visual approach to be able to distinguish the two random variables is shown in the diagram below:\n",

        "From this diagram it becomes clearer that a continuous random variable can be thought of as a continuous, smooth, connected range of possible values, whereas for a discrete random variable, we have a countable set of possible 'points' or outcomes. If we go back to the example of our dart throw, our random variable had four possible outcomes: $X \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. If we pick two possible outcomes, let's say 1 and 2, we see that there are no possible outcomes in between. This further confirms that it follows a discrete distribution.\n",

Well, we saw from the beginning that the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes must equal 1. However, in this case, there are infinitely many possible outcomes. What kind of issue does this lead to?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the sum of infinitely many positive numbers, no matter how big, is also infinity. Therefore, the individual probability of each outcome must be zero. But wait! Didn't we say the sum of the probabilities must be one? Then how does the sum of infinitely many zeros equal 1?!\n",

        "\n",
        "One way to analyse the likelihood of values of continuous random variables is that instead of looking at individual values, we consider the __likehood of a value being within a given range or interval__.

Therefore, this histogram is an __estimate of the probability distribution of the random variable we are investigating__.

This means that __when the size of the bins are too large, we are losing a lot of information about the underlying distribution!__ For example, by looking at the above histogram, we have no way of differentiating between the probability distribution of measuring 171cm or 173cm, since they are in the same bin.

The same logic can be applied to the standard deviation: if you, on average, are further away from the mean (hence a larger standard deviation), there is a larger probability of observing values further from the mean.

Nevertheless, it may still be extremely useful. For instance, if a continuous random variable has higher probabilities near its mean and lower probabilities away from the mean, we may be able to _approximate_ the underlying distribution as normal. There are multiple methods out there to verify how well we can model a variable with a normal distribution. We will not go over them in the scope of this chapter, but a simple way of verifying this is through the use of a histogram of the sampled data. As expected, the more data and more bins we use, the better we can verify this. \n",
